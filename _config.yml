# Welcome to Jekyll!


# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.

# Also, for your post bylines, add author info for yourself in `_data/authors.yml`.
# (Using that method instead of site.owner, in case your posts get cloned with your repo.)

  text: "I'm a Master's graduate in Construction Engineering and Project Management from Concordia University and a licensed architect in South Asia with a Bachelor's in Architecture. My thesis focused on mental health facility design, exploring how spatial planning influences well-being.\nProficient in Revit, AutoCAD, BIM 360, Navisworks, and Primavera P6, I've supported projects through subcontractor coordination, reviewing and redlining shop drawings, preparing RFIs/RFQs, tracking change orders, and updating project schedules.\nI've worked with engineers, MEP consultants, and civil contractors on commercial, residential, and public sector developments, ensuring deliverables meet design intent, budget, and timelines."

closing-para: Architecture transcends function; it is the repository of a people's memory. When this connection is lost, the built form ceases to speak.

# and full paths of the various OSes in compose.rb. For my Windows
# environment, I just put a subl.cmd file in my PATH that points to the full
# path to Sublime's subl.exe.) Also, put your most common post extension.
